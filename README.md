# Open All Ports Script

This script allows you to reset your iptables rules to accept all incoming and outgoing traffic on an Ubuntu system. It then saves the previous rules to a file and promotes the GitHub repository where the script is hosted.

## One-Click Installation and Execution

1. Open your terminal on an Ubuntu system.

2. Run the following command to download and execute the script directly from the repository:

   ```bash
   bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicoRuizDev/Scripts/main/open-all-ports.sh)"
   ```
